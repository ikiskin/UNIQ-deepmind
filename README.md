# UNIQ-deepmind
## Overview
Welcome to the [DeepMind UNIQ internship training](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/access/uniq-plus) course. This repository was made to introduce basic concepts within the powerful `scikit-learn` framework. It is divided into two modules in the form of colab notebooks:
1. [Introducing Scikit Learn](./colab/Introducing-Scikit-Learn-UNIQ.ipynb) from the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
    * Data Representation
    * Scikit-Learn's Estimator API
    * Supervised toy example
    * Unsupervised toy example
    * Hand-written digits toy example

2. A [colab notebook](./colab/UNIQ_scikit_learn_pt_2.ipynb) outlining a use case of `scikit-learn` in a real-world data science problem.
    * Data input processing
    * Dataset creation
    * Data feature extraction and pre-processing
    * Model instantiation and prediction
    * Model performance metrics

## Task lists
The task lists for each session are found here:
* [Task 1](./session_1_task_list.md)
* [Task 2](./session_2_task_list.md)

The training sessions are designed to be informal, so feel free to dive deep into any aspect of each task that may interest you. The task lists are designed to guide you through the material. For any help, please consult the module lead and demonstrators who are here to help you explore the content.
